## Awards and Honors

### Champion - Amazon Machine Learning Competition
#### Issued by Amazon Machine Learning University · Sep 2022

Twice winner of machine learning competitions at Amazon for Regression and Binary Classification data science competitions.

### Guest Speaker: Data Science Applications for Fleet Reliability
#### Issued by Caterpillar Inc. · May 2021

Shared machine learning methodology to predict diesel engine life in large off-highway trucks. Life was extended by 33%.

### Guest Speaker: Truck Rebuild Program
#### Issued by Caterpillar Inc. · Apr 2019

Spoke at Caterpillar large mining truck conference to discuss Empire-Cat’s truck rebuild program. Empire will completely rebuild a mining haul trucks at 60% of the cost of a new machine and operates with 2 to 4% more physical availability above trucks from the factory.

### Guest Speaker: Product Problem Management
#### Issued by Caterpillar Inc. · Sep 2015

Discussed Empire's reliability engineering program which involves a focus on "find it" using RCA, critical component life analysis, inspections, telematics, and condition monitoring, followed by identifying key factors using machine learning, and then implementing "fix it" solutions through interim corrective actions and working with Caterpillar's FMEA process for permanent solutions.
